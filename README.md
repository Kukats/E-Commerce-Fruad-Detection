E-Commerce Fraud Detection 🛒🔍

Overview 📢

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in e-commerce using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent transactions pose a significant threat to businesses, leading to financial losses and reputational damage. The project aims to build a predictive model to identify fraudulent transactions effectively.

Dataset 📊

The dataset contains transaction details, user information, device details, and fraud labels.

Features include:

User Details: Age, Gender, Country 🌍

Transaction Information: Purchase Value, Payment Method, Chip Usage 💳

Device Information: Browser, Device ID 🖥️📱

Timestamps: Signup Time, Purchase Time ⏳

Technologies Used 🛠️

Programming Language: R 🖥️

Libraries:

tidyverse - Data manipulation and visualization 📈

randomForest - Machine learning model 🌲

caTools - Data splitting ✂️

caret - Model evaluation ✅

Implementation ⚙️

Data Preprocessing

Converted categorical variables into factors.

Extracted time differences between signup and purchase time.

Removed unnecessary columns (User ID, IP Address, Device ID, etc.).

Handled missing values by omitting incomplete records.

Model Building 🧠

1. Random Forest Classifier 🌳

A Random Forest model was trained on the dataset to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Parameters used: 100 trees, 4 variables tried at each split.

Feature importance was calculated to understand key fraud indicators.

Evaluation Metrics 📏

Confusion Matrix for model performance assessment.

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Results 🏆

Identified key fraud indicators including high purchase value, unusual transaction times, and specific device/browser combinations.

Random Forest model provided robust results with high classification accuracy.

Fraud Prevention Strategies 🔐

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra security layer 🔑

Real-time Monitoring & Alerts: Detects fraud as it happens 🚨

Enhanced Identity Verification: Uses biometric authentication and behavioral analytics 👁️

Tokenization: Secures payment information by replacing sensitive data with tokens 🔒

Conclusion 🎯

The project demonstrates that machine learning can significantly improve fraud detection in e-commerce. By implementing advanced classification techniques, businesses can proactively reduce fraud and enhance security in digital transactions.
